1) Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2:


                                    HTTP1.1

             It allowed multiple requests/responses per TCP connection.
             The client (browser) has to send a request to the server 
             using the method (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE),we can conclude 
             that multiple TCP connections are essential.
             


                                    HTTP2 
               
             The major feature that differentiates HTTP/2 from HTTP/1.1 is
             the binary framing layer.As HTTP/2 supports multiple simultaneous
             responses to the client’s initial GET request,the server provides the
             required resource along with the requested HTML page.HTTP/2 supports 
             full multiplexing for requests as well as responses over a single 
             TCP connection.

2) Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript:


             objects objects and its internal representation in Javascript
              -----------------------------------------------------------
              
                  its collection of key and value,The values can 
                  consist of properties and methods.may contain 
                  all other JavaScript data types, such as strings
                  numbers, and Booleans.Objects are more complex 
                  and each object may contain any combination of 
                  these primitive data-types as well as reference   
                  data-types.
