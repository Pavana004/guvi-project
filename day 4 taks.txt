1)How to compare two JSON have the same properties without order?


  var obj1 = { name: "Person 1", age:5 };

  var obj2 = { age:5, name: "Person 1" };
 
 
  var a = JSON.stringify(obj1) === JSON.stringify(obj2);
 
   console.log(a);

2) Use the rest countries API url -> https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all and display all the country flags in console
         
            const url = "https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all";
            async function rest(){
            const response = await fetch(url);
            const data = await response.json();
            for(var i of data )
             console.log(i.flags);
          }
            rest();

I use async and await function which not take in class session,,and i use fetch ....
         
     Async functions will always return a value.
     It makes sure that a promise is returned and 
     if it is not returned then javascript automatically wraps it in a promise
     which is resolved with its value. 
     Await: Await function is used to wait for the promise.....


3) Use the same rest countries and print all countries name, region, sub region and population:


                              
                                  const url = "https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all";
                                    async function rest(){
                                    const response = await fetch(url);
                                    const data = await response.json();
                                   for(var i of data )
                                  console.log(i.population,i.subregion,i.region,i.continents);
                            }
                             rest();
